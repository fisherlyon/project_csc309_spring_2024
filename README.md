# CSC 309 Project -- MATH MADNESS

## Description
Our overall goal is to develop a math tutor, but with a twist. We are planning to have two panels. The left panel will be a visual in which there is some kind of duel going on between your character and your opponent's character. The right panel will be interactive and the goal is to solve various math problems using drag and drop on different numbers. Our motivation is to provide a math tutor for the youth. Our core idea is to make learning fun by combining a mathematical learning experience with a cool pvp visual aspect. <br>

</p>

Finally, we have made it to the gameplay screen. This screen may look different depending on which game mode selected. To play, the user can toggle betweenn the different mathematical operators at the top of the right panel and then drag and drop number blocks onto each other for the operations to actually occur. You are given a target number in the top left of the right panel and your goal is to reach that number using various mathematical operations. Once you obtain the target number, place it in the answer box at the bottom of the right panel. If the answer was correct, the number block will disappear and the answer box will turn green. If the answer was incorrect, the number block will remain in the answer box and the answer box will turn red. The goal is to knock-out your opponent by getting correct answers. Have fun playing!
